# This file contains definitions for gradient functions used for backprop in 
# AutogradTensor. The definitions are read by build_gradients.py, converted to 
# GradFunc classes as strings, then written to gradients.py.
#
# Each entry consists of:
#   - A 'name', corresponding to the signature of a Tensor method
#   - One or more gradient entries, for each of the method inputs with a gradient
#

# Other can be a Number or a Tensor and Python doesn't have multiple dispatch...
